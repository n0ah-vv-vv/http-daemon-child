I wrote this http server in my final semester of university as the final project for the course "Computer Architecture II."
I struggled with the project because I was very much a programming noob even in my final semester and completing it was a major achievement for me.
I remember that I always wanted to return to the code, but it's taken me almost four years to do so.

In this README I'll be documenting what I need to know to refactor and improve the code.
I want to try to mostly consult `man` pages to learn the things I need to know to understand the code.

## Helpful commands

#### Compile

``` sh
make all
```

#### Run http daemon

``` sh
./httpd
```

## Sockets


## Ideas

#### Testing

It would be nice if I could make the code testable before running it.

Deepseek just wrote a bunch of tests that seem to work out of the box.

## Learning

#### sockets

###### Amateur radio

Apparently you can make a socket radio?

```
AF_AX25      Amateur radio AX.25 protocol               ax25(4)
```

###### AF_INET, AF_INET6

IPv4 and IPv6 Internet protocols

###### AF_NETLINK

```
AF_NETLINK   Kernel user interface device               netlink(7)
```
